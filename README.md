## Installation

First this repository must be cloned to your local computer. Then running vscode or a similar software you must run command line 'npm init -y' then 'npm i inquirer@8.2.4'. Once all of that has been completed you can run command line 'node index.js' and answer all the questions provided to you to create a README file.

## Usage

End Users will use this product each time they need to create a README by running the program locally on their computers as outlined above.

[Video Demonstrating Usage](<Screen Recording.mov>)

A use case example would be if programmer Steve has created a recipe picker that fetches from an API, but he doesn't want to write out every detail of his project. He can run README Creator locally and answer a few questions to get a high quality README created for him.
